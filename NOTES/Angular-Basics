#Decorator: Decorators are a Typescript feature whichallow youto enhance your classes, for example Enhance elements you use in your code.
It's not restricted to class but here we will use a class decorator. Decorator always named by using '@' sign in the starting. 



APP MODULES: Angular uses components to build webpages and uses modules to basically bundle different pieces for example, componets of your app 
into packages.



DATABINDING: It means communication, the communication between TypeScript Code(Business Logic) and Template(HTML).
It is used to Output Data from [TypeScript Code to HTML Code] and it is done by: 
1. String Interpolation: {{ DATA }}  :- In the end it will return a string. 
🧠 Bas: HTML ke andar JavaScript ki value print karni ho to {{ }} use karo.

2. Property Binding: [property] = "data" :- Component (TypeScript file) ki value ko HTML element ke kisi property me set karna.
💬 "Component ki value HTML ke andar bhejna" — isko hi Property Binding bolte hain.
--> element-property → HTML element ka property (jaise value, disabled, src etc.)

📌 $event ➡️ Angular ka special variable hai jo kisi DOM event (📥 input, 🖱️ click, etc.) ka data carry karta hai, jisse hum event-related info access kar sakte hain.It will pass as an argument to the method we were calling. 

Another is From [HTML Code to TypeScript Code] and it is done by: 
3. Event Binding: (event) = "expression"

Combination of Both: Two-Way-Bindng([(ngModel)] = "data") -: Here you able to react events and output something at the same time.




🚀 What is a Directive in Angular?
🔧 A Directive is a special instruction in Angular that adds behavior to elements in the DOM (HTML).

There are three types of directives in Angular:
1️⃣ Component Directive:
✅ Every component is actually a directive with a template.
Created using @Component decorator.
It controls a part of the UI.

2️⃣ Structural Directive
🧱 These directives change the structure of the DOM (add/remove elements).
They use a * prefix.
🔹 Examples:
Directive	           Use
*ngIf	        Show/hide elements conditionally
*ngFor	        Loop through items in a list
*ngSwitch	    Conditional switching



3️⃣ Attribute Directive
🎨 These directives change the appearance or behavior of an element.
They are added as attributes to elements.
🔹 Built-in Examples:
Directive	        Purpose
ngClass	         Add/remove CSS classes
ngStyle	         Set dynamic styles
[disabled]	     Bind property to enable/disable
